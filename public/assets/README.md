# Assets Folder

This folder contains the Olumba logo and other assets.

## Logo Files Required

Please save the Olumba logo image in this folder with the following filenames:

1. **olumba-logo.png** - The main logo (with the circular icon and "Olumba" text)
   - Used in: Navigation bar, landing page header
   - Recommended size: 400x100px or similar aspect ratio

2. **olumba-logo-white.png** - Same logo for dark backgrounds
   - Used in: Footer (will be inverted to white using CSS)
   - Can be the same file as olumba-logo.png

The logo should show:
- Circular icon with construction/architecture elements (crane, building)
- Blue and yellow/gold colors
- "Olumba" text next to the icon

## Current Status

⚠️ **Action Required**: Please save the uploaded logo image as `olumba-logo.png` in this directory.

Once saved, the logo will appear in:
- ✅ Landing page navigation
- ✅ App header (all authenticated pages)
- ✅ Footer

## Alternative

If you prefer to use the logo image directly without saving it twice, you can:
1. Save the image once as `olumba-logo.png`
2. The footer uses CSS filters (`brightness-0 invert`) to convert it to white
